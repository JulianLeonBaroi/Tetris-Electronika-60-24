  <h2> About </h2>
  Alexey Pajitnov called this game “Tetris®,” a combination of “tetra” (the Greek word meaning “four”) and “tennis” (his favorite sport). This program is a tribute to
  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexey_Pajitnov">Alexey Pajitnov</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henk_Rogers">Henk Rogers</a>. Besides this, It was created 
  to give this to my elder sister as her birthday gift on her birthday.
